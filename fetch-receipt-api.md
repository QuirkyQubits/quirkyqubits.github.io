## 📌 Overview

This project is a digital points system that awards reward points based on shopping receipts. You enter details from a purchase - like the store name, total amount, and items bought - and the app calculates how many points that receipt earns.

The project was built as part of a challenge from Fetch Rewards, a company known for rewarding users for everyday purchases. It’s designed to demonstrate how purchase information can be processed and scored automatically.

## 🚀 How It Works

You give the app a digital version of your receipt, and it uses a set of scoring rules to figure out how many points it’s worth. Different purchases earn different points - for example, based on the amount spent or the time of day you shopped.

Developers can run this system on their own computers or inside a container using Docker.
