# 📟 Fetch Receipt Processor Project

## 📌 Overview

This project is a digital points system that awards users for their shopping receipts. By entering details like the store name, total amount, and purchased items, the app calculates how many points each receipt earns.

Built as part of a challenge from Fetch Rewards, a company that rewards users for everyday purchases, the project demonstrates how purchase data can be programmatically processed and scored.

This page aims to provide a **non-technical summary** of the project. The codebase itself is solely focused on the API layer - the behind-the-scenes system that processes receipt data and returns reward point calculations. For full implementation details and setup instructions, see the README in the GitHub repository, which is written specifically for developers.

## 🚀 How It Works

The user provides a digital version of a receipt, and the system uses a set of scoring rules to determine how many points it’s worth. Different purchases earn different points - for example, based on the amount spent or the time of day the purchase occurred.
