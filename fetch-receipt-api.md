## ðŸ“Œ Overview

This project implements a Django-based REST API that calculates reward points from submitted retail receipt data. It was developed as part of the Fetch Rewards receipt processor coding challenge.

Users submit a JSON receipt to the Process API and receive a unique ID. This ID can then be used to query the Points API to determine how many points the receipt earned based on specific business rules.

## ðŸš€ How to Use
