# KanjiLearner â€“ Full-Stack Spaced Repetition App

**Date:** July 2025 â€“ Sept 2025  

KanjiLearner is a full-stack web application I developed to help learners study kanji using a spaced repetition system (SRS). It includes lessons, reviews, mistake tracking, and customizable mnemonics.

## ðŸš€ Tech Stack
- React (TypeScript, Vite) + Tailwind CSS
- Django + PostgreSQL
- Deployed to Vercel (frontend) and Render (backend + DB)

## ðŸ“Œ Outcome
Within three months I shipped a production-ready MVP that I continue to use for my own Japanese studies. The project demonstrates end-to-end ownership of data modeling, API design, frontend development, and production deployment.
