    <h1>KanjiLearner ‚Äì Full-Stack Spaced Repetition App</h1>
    <p><strong>Date:</strong> July 2025 ‚Äì Sept 2025</p>
  
    <p>
      KanjiLearner is a full-stack web application I developed to help learners study kanji using a spaced repetition system (SRS). 
      It includes lessons, reviews, mistake tracking, and customizable mnemonics.
    </p>
  
    <h2>üöÄ Tech Stack</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>React (TypeScript, Vite) + Tailwind CSS</li>
      <li>Django + PostgreSQL</li>
      <li>Deployed to Vercel (frontend) and Render (backend + DB)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>üìå Outcome</h2>
    <p>
      Within three months I shipped a production-ready MVP that I continue to use for my own Japanese studies. 
      The project demonstrates end-to-end ownership of data modeling, API design, frontend development, and production deployment.
    </p>
    
    <h2>‚öôÔ∏è Development Highlights</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Pitch Accent Graph:</strong> Implemented an interactive SVG component that splits Japanese words into morae and plots
        their pitch pattern (low/high). This allows learners to visualize pronunciation patterns such as <code>LHH</code> or <code>LH(L)</code>,
        which are critical for sounding natural in spoken Japanese.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Efficient Pagination:</strong> Integrated <code>React Query</code> to handle server-side pagination of dictionary entries.
        The client caches responses and seamlessly fetches the next page, ensuring smooth navigation even across thousands of kanji, radicals, and vocabulary items.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Highlighting System:</strong> Built a custom text highlighter that parses <code>&lt;radical&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;kanji&gt;</code>,
        <code>&lt;vocab&gt;</code>, and <code>&lt;reading&gt;</code> tags from API responses. These tags are rendered with distinct styles, making it easy
        for learners to quickly distinguish between character types and readings in mnemonics and explanations.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Review Runner State Machine:</strong> Designed the review flow as a React reducer with action/state dispatch, functioning as a
        lightweight state machine. This controls card flipping, answer validation, success/failure logging, and SRS progression updates,
        ensuring consistent behavior across study sessions.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Responsive UI Design:</strong> Styled the frontend with <code>Tailwind CSS</code>, using Flexbox and CSS Grid layouts
        for clean, responsive pages. The dashboard adapts across screen sizes, presenting lessons, reviews, and mistakes in a balanced layout.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Authentication & Security:</strong> Used <code>Axios</code> with Django‚Äôs CSRF protection and sessionId cookies for
        secure, cookie-based authentication. This ensures that user sessions remain persistent and protected without exposing tokens.
      </li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>
      Overall, KanjiLearner combines thoughtful pedagogy with robust engineering: from data modeling and spaced repetition logic to
      React-driven interactivity and production deployment. It serves both as a personal study tool and as a demonstration of full-stack
      development.
